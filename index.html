										<h2 class="major">interest in it</h2>
										<p>I am interested in IT because IT is transforming various industries and almost every company needs someone to do IT stuff. My interest in IT started when I was deeply attracted by video games in primary school.
											At that time, my cousin played video games a lot. I enjoyed watching him to play various video games and learned the basis of operating PC from him. When I was in secondary school, 
											I learned to install windows system, write code and use various softwares by myself. Sometimes my friends may ask me to install system or fix somes bugs of their PC.</p>
										<p>There are many reasons for me to choose to study at RMIT University. First, The course in RMIT is practical, where students may get crucial knowledeg about what they are supposed to do in the work place. 
										Also, RMIT has excellent facilities and friendly employees, which are important for students to master the knowledge and achieve their goals.</p>
										<p>I expect to learn practical skills. Especiall programming, communication and data science, which may help me get a IT related job.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
										<p>INTP PERSONALITY (“THE LOGICIAN”)</p>
<p>The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there’s nothing they’d be more unhappy about than being "common". INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, INTPs have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history.</p>
										<p>Visual</p>
<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.

As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:

Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)
Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words.
Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.
Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.
Color code things.
Avoid distractions during study times.
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>
										<p>Character Strengths</p>
										<p>1: Honesty
Speaking the truth but more broadly presenting oneself in a genuine way and acting in
a sincere way; being without pretense; taking responsibility for one's feelings and
actions.
2: Creativity
Thinking of novel and productive ways to conceptualize and do things; includes
artistic achievement but is not limited to it.
3: Love of learning
Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or
formally; related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the
											tendency to add systematically to what one knows.</p>
<p>The results above could help me know myself better. For a pretty long time, I have been constantly doubting why my way of thinking is always different from others. From INTP Personality test, I realised that my personality type is rare that only around 3% people have this kind of personality. It also tells me my personality has several excellent advantages with enhanced my confidence and courage.</P>
									<p>After taking the test, I realised that I am good at doing research. So, when I need to work in a team, I will be tend to do more research work. By doing this, I may better use my strenth and be more efficient.</p>
									<p>When forming a team, I will try to find someone who is open-minded and sociable, who could assist me on my advantages and do what I am not good at well.</p>
