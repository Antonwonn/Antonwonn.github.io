										<h2 class="major">interest in it</h2>
										<p>I am interested in IT because IT is transforming various industries and almost every company needs someone to do IT stuff. My interest in IT started when I was deeply attracted by video games in primary school.
											At that time, my cousin played video games a lot. I enjoyed watching him to play various video games and learned the basis of operating PC from him. When I was in secondary school, 
											I learned to install windows system, write code and use various softwares by myself. Sometimes my friends may ask me to install system or fix somes bugs of their PC.</p>
										<p>There are many reasons for me to choose to study at RMIT University. First, The course in RMIT is practical, where students may get crucial knowledeg about what they are supposed to do in the work place. 
										Also, RMIT has excellent facilities and friendly employees, which are important for students to master the knowledge and achieve their goals.</p>
										<p>I expect to learn practical skills. Especiall programming, communication and data science, which may help me get a IT related job.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
										<p>INTP PERSONALITY (“THE LOGICIAN”)</p>
<p>The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there’s nothing they’d be more unhappy about than being "common". INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, INTPs have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history.</p>
										<p>Visual</p>
<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.

As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:

Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)
Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words.
Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.
Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.
Color code things.
Avoid distractions during study times.
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>
										<p>Character Strengths</p>
										<p>1: Honesty
Speaking the truth but more broadly presenting oneself in a genuine way and acting in
a sincere way; being without pretense; taking responsibility for one's feelings and
actions.
2: Creativity
Thinking of novel and productive ways to conceptualize and do things; includes
artistic achievement but is not limited to it.
3: Love of learning
Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or
formally; related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the
											tendency to add systematically to what one knows.</p>
<p>The results above could help me know myself better. For a pretty long time, I have been constantly doubting why my way of thinking is always different from others. From INTP Personality test, I realised that my personality type is rare that only around 3% people have this kind of personality. It also tells me my personality has several excellent advantages with enhanced my confidence and courage.</P>
									<p>After taking the test, I realised that I am good at doing research. So, when I need to work in a team, I will be tend to do more research work. By doing this, I may better use my strenth and be more efficient.</p>
									<p>When forming a team, I will try to find someone who is open-minded and sociable, who could assist me on my advantages and do what I am not good at well.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
									<p>Overview</p>
									<p>My project idea is to create a free and  easy-to-use VPN (Virtual Private Network). Users need to install a software and have  a crypto currency wallet address to use it. Everyone who wants to use it for free needs to receive Ads and also make his/her own device a VPN server for others to connect. By doing this , they can also receive a kind of crypto currency called VPNC (Virtual-Private-Network Coin). Users can always pay fiats or VPNC to remove ads and stop sharing with others. There will be a small discount if users choose to pay VPNC. Users can get VPNC by sharing their devices or buying it on exchanges. The VPN servers are decentralised, private and secure.</p> 

									<p>Motivation</p>
									<p>Nowadays, World Wide Web plays an important role in almost every part of life. It is never been so easy and convinent to get information from other countries or communicate with people overseas. However, in some authoritarian states, the government see the Internet as a threat to their absolute control of power and people's thoughts. </p>
									<p>Description</p>
									<p>People who wish to download can send a email with crypto currency wallet address to the email address which is owned by the the project company. A VPNC with download link of the software will be automatically sent to the crypto currency wallet address. This may naturalise Internet filtering from authoritarian government as users no longer need to go to a certain website to get a download address. Besides, nether the wallet nor the coin can be deleted by anyone.  With smart contract, this coin can not be sent to another address by users and will be automatically sent back in a period of time. Thus the company can have enough coins to send to new users.Once downloaded, users can choose a VPN address and connect. People can use the VPN for free if they agree to receive ads and share their devices for other users to connect. They can also pay to remove ads and stop sharing to others. The payment can be done with fiat (normal rate) or VPNC (discount rate). Users can gain VPNC by sharing their devices for others to connect, they can also sell it on exchanges for others to buy. There will be part of VPNC reserved for developers, as the demand for VPNC increases, the price is likely to rise. Which will be one of main sources of income together with ads revenue.As each user is a single server, the VPN network is decentralised and the capability can increase through the increase of users. Which means the project does not require upgrading servers, and could effectively make sure users’ security. Besides, the rewards of VPNC may also attract people to share their devices for users to connect.</p>
									<p>Tools and Technologies</p>
									<p>To launch the project, we need a software to automatically check mailbox, get wallet address and send coin with download address for the VPN software. This software needs to be secure and steady, as which is the main source for people to download the VPN software. We also need several servers in different countries for users to connect, when there is not enough people to share their devices. Finally, we need both software and hardware to protect servers from attack, which may come from both dictators and competitors.</p>
									<p>Skills Required</p>
									<p>There needs someone who knows blockchain Technology to create the crypto currency of VPNC, which is the core of the project. Besides, someone needs to construct the VPN sites sharing networks to connect users and sharers. Then, someone must find a way to advertise the project to increase users. Finally, someone needs to make sure the security of the project.</p>
									<p>Outcome</p>
									<p>Once the project succeeds, people in authoritarian countries will no longer be restricted on the Internet, which may significantly enhance the democratic movement in such countries and make governments hard to brainwash people. Besides, people in different parts of the world could communicate freely, which may effectively solve problems caused by isolation and misunderstandings.</p>
